  CopyWithQ
=============

**Automatic Quotes**

Simple javascript for automatic citation creation.
When use selects a part of the text, and copy it in the usual way
(both the shortcut Ctrl + c works and the use of the context menu called up by the right mouse button, the citation is automatically added to the copied text.

It creates 3 different data types (depends on `settings`) in clipboard. Plain text, HTML snippet and single link. Snippets are used by data type when pasting (CTRL + V) the data. For example pasting in `notepad` it places plain text, when pasting in Word or [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/) it places rich html snippet.

What's new in version 2.0
------------------------

- Removed jQuery dependency. Away with jQuery!
- Added Scroll-to-text Fragment feature ([support in Chrome, Edge and Opera only](https://caniuse.com/#feat=url-scroll-to-text-fragment))
- Ability to get a link with the selected part of the text by selecting the text and using the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + L

Use
---

Paste the script file anywhere in the page, like any regular `javascript` module

``` html
<script type="module" src="/copyWithQ.mjs" crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha256-eX4Yr7bQ38SW3yw8IoeRAvu5rr1Kd2wP4pRoe/45NRE="></script>
<script type="module">
	import { CopyWithQ } from '/copyWithQ.mjs';
	new CopyWithQ;
</script>
```

When instantiating a class, you can pass a parameter (string or HTMLLinkElement) to the constructor, which will then be used as the author of the copied text. javascript:

``` javascript
new CopyWithQ('Jon Doe');
```

using second parameter, you can adjust the script settings, for example, as follows:

``` javascript
import { CopyWithQ } from '/copyWithQ.mjs';
const settings = {
	modulesImportPath: '/vendor/js/modules',
	autoQuotesMinLength: 240,
};
new CopyWithQ( 'John Doe', settings );
```

### a simple example of usage is in the `example-usage.html` file ###

Why is there script embedding 2 times?
 Isn't the whole first script `<script type="module" â€¦></script>` useless? It would work without him. Yes, it worked, but it would not be possible to check the integrity of the javascript module without it.

# Possible problems?
The mjs extension must have the correct mime type set to `text/javascript`, if it is too laborious, rename the suffix from `.mjs` to `.js`.
